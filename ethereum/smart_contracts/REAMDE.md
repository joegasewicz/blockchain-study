# Smart Contracts

### Smart Contract Programming Languages
Languages that output *EVM* **(EVM is what is run on the blockchain)** bytecode:
- Vyper *(researched-oriented, derived from Python)*
- Solidity
- LLL *(like low level Lisp)*
- Serpent *(similar to Python)*
- Mutan *(deprecated Go-based langauge)*

A smart contract is a piece of code running on the blockchain.
- It's a state machine
- Needs transactions to change state
- Can do logic operations

State change happens through the following:
- Mining + Transactions.

It's Turing complete - in theory it can solve any computation problem.
